# My 2024 goals

In the last post I wrote that my goal was to become relevant in my field.

It became clear to me now this is what I want. Before I thought it would be too hard,
because I thought I needed to devise new theories or something like that. But now I realized
I could become relevant by contributing in other ways, like content creating and
knowledge sharing.

But still, that is a bold goal, and I will enlist here some minor objectives to accomplish
in 2024 that I think will help me get closer to that end goal.

## Read more, and more specialized material

This is a goal I missed in 2023. Well, sort of. I read a lot in 2023 I think, but
I need to make a habit to read more specialized material. By these, I mean periodics
like journals and articles.

I am a member of IEEE and some societies, like Computer Society, and have some
access to articles and magazines, IEEE Software for one.

Last year I made a promise when renewing the subscription that I would actually read
them. But yeah, it was a lie, I didn't read much.

Let make it happen this year!

## Write more

I was watching a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnt6P7Rnho8) with Jordan
Peterson about how to improve public speaking. To put it simple, he tells us we
need to read a lot (last item) and practice by writing.

I haven't post here much often last year, or anywhere to be honest.

The only thing I wrote a lot last year was code. This year I will be more constantly
updating this blog.

## To care more about myself

By that I mean more about vanity. I had this goal in 2023 also and failed miserably.

For instance, I think I cut my hair last year about 4 times or less. I can't remember
the last time I bought myself new clothes.

I definitely needs to appreciate myself more often.

## Learn more about AI

Since the start of the field, in the Alan Turing papers, AI was a big goal to CS.

Every CS student is interest in this topic, or was at some point. So it's not only
about the hype.

I have already studied a fair amount of machine learning, like the classical algorithms
and some of neural networks.

But this year I will try to learn more about transformers and the LLMs that are
making the world crazy!

## Learn more about game dev

As I mentioned before, I am an avid gamer.

I always wanted to code a game.

In 2024 I will create one, even if it's a small one, just to start game dev.

## New technologies to learn

There is some technologies I wish to learn more in 2024, that includes:

- Rails hotwire
- HTMLx
- Elixir and Phoenix
- Rust and integration with python using PyO3

I know those are big endeavors on their own, but I thin I can do it.

## Closing regards

Those are some things I want to do in 2024.

When closing 2024 I will come back to this post. Let's see how many of those
objectives I concluded!
