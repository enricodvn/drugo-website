# Why blogging now?

So, people might wonder why I am blogging just now, in 2023.

I have plenty of reasons. In this post I will comment some below. I will not talk
about the technical details (leaving them for a later post), but instead my motivations.

## Dev log

One of my mistakes that I really regret not doing since I started my journey in
software development is to keep a dev log.

To be honest, I always thought it was a good idea to keep a daily diary, the ones
you see in teenage girls movies. One of the reasons is to remember things as close
as they really happened, because the memory is really deceiving. We are meant to
forget, so we can create new memories, and every time you remember something, you
change this memory forever, because you have activated that neural network, and
hence changed it. The second reason is to leave something for the posterity. I
always wanted my grandfather to have a diary, so I could read and really know him.
He died when I was young, I was just a kid, I didn't have the chance to really
know him better.

In a dev log, you can remember why you have encountered that bug or difficulty, the
context and how exactly you acted to overcome it. With it, next time you find something
similar you will have a really precise start point to guide you. And keeping it
public, you might help other people that happens to stumble across the same problems.

I really regret not doing this before. I can always excuse saying that I was so busy,
but I think it was my fault not finding the time to do it, as I did before I started
exercising.

## To practice writing

Well, to me, programming is writing. You write code for the machine, but also to
your fellow colleagues to understand. If you are concise and clear, your code is
easier to read and to maintain.

I think that writing, as any other skill, can be improved by practice. So, by writing
these blog posts I might end up becoming a better programmer.

## To enhance creativity

To code and develop programs, we all are driven by the desire to create something.

This is the burning flame of creativity. I think being creative really help software
developers to solve problems better.

By blog posting, I can also improve my creative thinking.

## To expose myself to the world

Thats simple. I have always being low profile in social media. I don't even have
an instagram account (which some friends really nag about).

I am really shy in twitter, and use it most for consuming news and media, instead
of creating. To be honest, I am a introvert people, even in my daily social life.

That way, it's really hard to know that I exist. BUT I DO, HELLO WORLD!

But seriously, by exposing myself I might find new contacts to interact and even
find new job opportunities.

## I was inspired by some others

There are some other developers that really inspired me and have these amazing
blogs. To name a few:

 - [Willian Justen](https://willianjusten.com.br/): He is an instructor in Udemy,
mostly in front-end development. I find his blog amazing. I am also fan of his
photography.
 - [Jaime Biernaski](https://www.jaimebiernaski.com/): He was a fellow colleague
from a startup we worked together for almost 2 years. He was a tech lead
in front-end mobile development in that company. I always liked him, what a great
guy, and really expert. He then left to work for Coinbase. I think his blog
really helped him to land this job, because he had really good content on
react native.
 - [Vladikk](https://vladikk.com/): The blogs above were both created by front-end
 guys, but this one is from a back-end wizard. Vladikk is the author of my favorite
 tech books.
 - [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/index): When I started web
 development, his blog was everything I needed to learn flask. I am really thankful
 for his tutorials in python. Later I got his book in flask and in SQLAlchemy.

 There is really more, but this post would become longer and boring. But all of
 these developers are great and inspire me, and maybe if I follow their footsteps
 I can become better too.

## To welcome our AI overlords

2023 is the year I have seen the most rapid development of AI in the recent times.

AI is trained using data from internet. Maybe if I have a persona in the internet,
and post on AI and ML, our new overlords have some mercy with Drugo.

## Because is never to late

Really, if you want to do something, it's never to late. I believe in that.

I really wanted to make a blog, and here I am now. I know it's 2023, old man. We
have tiktok now, youtube, podcasts, etc. But when I was young, and started browsing,
blogs were the thing. It's nostalgic for me.

But no matter your age, if you do it blogging, podcasting, tiktoking, just do it.
Share your knowledge and your vision with the world. I don't know, maybe even I can
inspire others...
