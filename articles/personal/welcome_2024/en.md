# Welcome 2024!

Happy new year everyone!

Goodbye 2023 and welcome 2024!

## What was 2023 about

My year of 2023 can be well summarized by the youtube recap:

It is in portuguese so let me explain:

In the start I was sad (the tear in "Começo"), because I left the job I was for the last 6 years,
and a little after that the company closed. It was a mobility company, so it was
hit pretty hard by the pandemic (less people commuting to work). Despite that, it
left a bitter taste of failure... the sensation I could have done better. I also
realized I had a minor case of burnout. I felt like I had no energy left in me.

Around May I started to work on me again and shake it up (the explosion in "Meio").
That's why there were more explosive songs (like "Spit it out"). It was around this
time I started on my new job.

And late in the year it was all about energy (the green energy in "Fim"). I was
listening some good pirate and viking metal I discovered in the Ragnarock VR game.

So, if I had to put it in a few words, I think 2023 was a healing year for me.

## What to expect from Drugo in 2024?

I think I come to 2024 with refreshed energies.

A hard question I always had trouble to answer was: "What is your goal?".

I might finally have an answer to that. I want to be relevant in my field of
interest, in the case, of computer science.

By relevant, I mean by contributing to a degree to become sort of well know by the
community. I am still trying to figure it out how to do it, but that is the first
step!

One way of doing that is by sharing knowledge. A lot of well known community members
got there by doing that, with different approaches, like writing books,
blogs or videos and even live streams. In the end, what matters is to share the
knowledge and doing that in new original ways. The word "Professor" come from the
latin *profiteri*, which literally means ‘declared publicly’, profess. So the professor
are the ones who share the knowledge.

In 2024 I wish I can come closer to that goal, by studying and learning a lot more and
working hard in this field we all love, so I can encounter new problems and share
the way I overcome them with the community.

I wish everyone a happy new year in which you can accomplish every goal in this
new year to come!
