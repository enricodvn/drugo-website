# What I am doing lately in 2023

This is just a blog update! I am missing new blog posts here in a while, so
just to post something I will write about my whereabouts in late 2023.

## What I am up to lately

So, when I created this blog, I had just left my job in the company I was working
for the past 6 years, which started as a start-up. So big changes in the routine
bring big changes in habit.

That's why I was so excited about blog posting (and still am). But my spare time
lasted only for some time, because I started working in a new job just after I
created the blog!

I am a person that has troubles spanning my attention in multiples subjects at once.
I usually laser focus my effort in one interest, and leave the others in a queue.
But I don't usually give up things. I just postpone them.

That's why, lately, I am focused on my new work. I've been there for almost 6
months now. As a back-end engineer, I need to become really familiar with the
business rules, and I am working harder now in the beginning because of this,
since I have never worked in this business domain before.

## My new job

I am working for a company in the Dropshipping business. Before, I have never
heard about this business domain, but I found it really interesting. This model
is not so much popular in Brazil yet, that's why it was so unfamiliar to me.

But I found the company business model really unique, and I liked the
team and also the tech stack. And the product, of course!

The stack uses mainly ruby on rails and react. It has some python also in the mix.
I never though I would be working with Ruby, but I am really enjoying it. That's
why I couldn't write much also, because I was busy rusting off my ruby skills
in the spare time. I will blog post about my opinions on this language soon!

Lastly, this new company is in Canada! I am finally realizing my dream to work
for a foreign company. This makes me work even harder. Also, it's remote (duh),
and is something new for me, whom was used to working on a 9-5 office job.

All in all, I am really enjoying working there. The company is really innovative,
has a great leadership (the CEO is a Forbes under 30 Stanford guy) and a really
nice team.

## Personal life

Since this new job is remote, I have some troubles separating work from personal
life. To be honest, I always had trouble doing that. But when it's a office job,
I think it is easier to just left the troubles in the office and come back to it
the other day.

Being remote, I am always thinking about the job, and these borders are more blurred.
I also got myself working more in holidays and weekends lately.

But out of the job, I am reading a lot lately. I will make a new section about books
soon.

Other than reading I am spending time with my family. My daughter is 3.5 years now,
and she is communicating really well!

Aside from blog posting, other habit that I had just gained after leaving the last
job was working out. But now I am being really lazy lately. I need to hit the gym
more often, even more now that I spend most of my time seated!

Finally, I am gaming more now. I was always an avid gamer, but couldn't find
time for it. But now, since I don't lose more time commuting, and have a more flexible
work time, I can play some games here and there.

## Being grateful

That's it! Got a new good job, which I am thrilled about, and am reading and gaming
lately! I am really grateful for that!
