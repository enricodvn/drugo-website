# Why I am called Drugo

I think I should address this here to avoid confusions.

Many people may think that the nickname Drugo may be related to drugs, but it is
not the case (realy!).

In the high-school, I had a teacher that was very old. Before every class, teachers
called the students names for presence. Once, when she was calling mine, she
misspeled my name as Endrigo. It's not her fault, everyone will lose sight eventually.

But it is not hard to guess that this made my friends joke a lot. They started to
call me Drigo. Then, for reasons unknown even to me (perhaps it's more tender),
they started calling me Drugo.

And that's it. I didn't fight back, so I don't know why it stick. I think its just
easier than call Enrico.

Later, on college, people didn't know that nickname, so my colleagues from
electrical engineering don't call me Drugo even today.

But some time after I finished my masters degree, a friend from the school
invited me to join a startup he had just founded. It was a big career change for
me, but I will address this in another topic.

Since he was from that time, he called me Drugo as everyone else in the startup.

I worked there for 6 years and made a lot of acquaintance when the company grew,
and each one of them called me Drugo, and that's the story.

Curiously, this friend of mine created the nickname of most of my childhood friends,
but not mine!

I don't love it, but don't hate this nickname either, and found the domain drugo.io
pretty neat, so I will keep using it.

So, anyway, you can call me Drugo!
