# Shame on me

On my [2024 goals article](/articles/personal/my_2024_goals) I wrote that I wanted
to write more. Well, as you can realize, I failed miserably on this one.

Turns our, being a dad is really time consuming.

## What am I doing lately in 2025

Well, I am working a lot, and for the remaining time I get I try to spend time with
my family as much as I can. My daughter is 5 now, she is becoming really clever!

In 2024, as you can see, I did not write any single article. Late on that year,
I resumed a hobby long forgotten, from the time I was a child, which is fishing.

So since late 2024 I am fishing quite a lot, almost every weekend. I go
to places where I can fish and my family can enjoy the day, like beaches. I
think I might even create an Instagram to post my fishing stories/pictures.

One thing I did right from those 2024 goals, then, is that I cared more to myself.
Also, although not so much, I cannot say I did not learn or study anything.

## My work

So far I am 2 years and 3 months in my current job. Recently I started working with
django again, so I am really comfortable with that.

Also started working with a new technology, which is Remix, for Shopify embedded
apps, using polaris components. I am actually enjoying quite a lot that stack!

## Tropical on Rails

This year I also attended the Tropical on Rails conference that happened here in
SÃ£o Paulo!

It was really good. Loved the talks (which are all available here [here](https://www.rubyevents.org/events/tropical-on-rails-2025)). Also got the chance to meet
a guy I really look up to, Jackson Pires.

When I switched careers (from electrical engineer to coding) one of the first
courses I took was his on Rest API. I really liked his teaching method, so I
took almost every courses he offered in Udemy (he now has his own [platform](https://videosdeti.com.br/)). If you want to learn Ruby on Rails, I really encourage you
to take his courses on his website (if you are brazilian ofc)!

## I am alive!

So yeah, I am alive, just wanted to update. I will soon do a revamp to this website,
and post some technical stuff that I am cooking in my subconscious, and some others
that are long due in the pipeline.

Probably no one is reading this, but see you around!
